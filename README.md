# KirbyTest: Scalable Form Submission QA Tool

## Overview

**KirbyTest** is an innovative and user-friendly QA tool designed to automate the testing and validation of web forms. Inspired by the playful spirit of Kirby, this tool aims to simplify the process of ensuring form functionality, usability, and accessibility across various platforms. Whether you're a developer or a tester, KirbyTest empowers you to launch forms that work flawlessly while providing a delightful user experience.

## Key Features

- **Automated Testing**: Define forms using simple JSON or YAML configurations and automate the testing process. KirbyTest simulates user inputs and validates responses against expected outcomes to ensure your forms behave as intended.

- **Scalability**: Built on asynchronous programming, KirbyTest can handle multiple simultaneous form submissions, making it ideal for high-traffic applications and real-world testing scenarios.

- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports that highlight test results, including success rates, error messages, and logs for each test run. Quickly identify and address issues to maintain form integrity.

- **Integration Ready**: Easily integrate KirbyTest into your CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that your forms are continually tested with every deployment or code change.

- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Leverage tools like Selenium to verify form functionality across various browsers and devices, ensuring a consistent user experience for all users.

- **Accessibility Compliance**: Automatically check your forms against accessibility standards to ensure they are usable by everyone, including those with disabilities.

- **Interactive Dashboard**: Monitor real-time performance and visualize trends over time through an intuitive web-based dashboard, making it easy to track the health of your forms.

## Current Progress

KirbyTest is currently in active development, and we are excited about the innovative features we are implementing. Here's a glimpse of whatâ€™s in progress:

- **Asynchronous Form Testing**: We are finalizing the asynchronous testing capabilities to ensure that KirbyTest can efficiently handle multiple form submissions at once.
  
- **Reporting Features**: Enhancements to the reporting module are underway, allowing users to generate custom reports and export results in various formats (CSV, PDF).

- **Dashboard Development**: The interactive dashboard is in the works, with features to visualize form performance and user interactions.

- **Community Input**: We value community feedback and contributions. Your insights can help shape the direction of KirbyTest, making it even more useful for developers and testers.
